<p class="mb-4">
  During this lab, I tested GitHub Copilot with both the default GPT-4o model and also chatgpt o1 model to see which gave me a more relevant and accurate suggestions. My main goal was to integrate Alpine.js and Tailwind with Eleventy and also testing the api from dummyjson,
  and both models were able to provide code snippets for fetching JSON data but only was able to help me with the task.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  The 4o model was able to answer some questions about the assignment and also showing me how to do it. But since it does not go into specific and but the o1 model was able to interpret with me and understand the assignment and it even go further. below is an example I try to implement using o1 model.
